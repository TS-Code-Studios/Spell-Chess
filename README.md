#### ------------------------------ [ CHESS GUI README STARTS HERE ] ---------------------------
FIRST OF ALL: NO BS IN MY GUI!!!!!!!!!
second of all: welcome to simonkdevs piece of work

**Disclaimer:** I migrated from Arch to nixOS recently so I might switch IDEs and notations from time to time

## ----- [ explanation of components ] ---------
Chessboard.java (based on JPanel)
- contains all 64 chessButtons, which have the attribute "name". This String contains their X and Y position in the Chessboard

y
1|                                      
2|                       x
3|

   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  x

example: buttonh2

- HINT: the position[][] array uses format[y][x], so in constructor, the args from chessButton(X, Y), are converted to Y, X. 

example: we call chessButton("h","2") to create the button for field h2. During call, the name is generated ("buttonh2"), and the posX and posY attributes are set to the different one. (posY contains the function argument X etc.). This is done so we can later call the array using position[posX][posY]

ChessBoardGUI.java (based on JFrame)
- contains the Board Panel as well as other UI elements, such as quit or emoji buttons

MainMenuGUI.java (based on JFrame)
- contains elements needed to load a game, as well as friends etc.
